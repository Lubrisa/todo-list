# TODO List App

This app is a simple TODO list app that allows users to execute every CRUD
operation on a list of tasks. The app is built using only web technologies
(HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) and it uses the browser's local storage to store
the tasks.

The main idea behind this project is to practice the use of web technologies
and fundamental programming concepts, like state management and event handling.
